## Description
This portfolio was created to display my work and web applications so that a potential employer can view what projects I have created. This allows the employer to see whether or not I am a good match for their company whether that comes down to skill or technologies used. 

The portfolio displays a responsive navbar created using Bootstrap. The navbar also has a created custom class to keep up the continuity of the color scheme. The Navbar has links to the different sections of the page and a downloadble PDF link of my Resume. Each work item has a link to their deployed and GitHub pages. There is also a contact info section at the bottom of the page that has various ways to contact me.

Technologies used in the making of my portfolio page include HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.
