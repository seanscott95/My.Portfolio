# Week.2.Homework

This was created to display a portfolio and web applications that a potential employee has created. All so an employee can see whether or not that are a suitable candidate for a job application.

(Note: Creations and resume need to be addded at a later date).

This consists of a portfolio that has a layout that is neat and orderly. A Navbar that has links to the different sections of the page. The work items have links to their (future) respective pages. CSS has been used to order and style the page. Media queries used when page gets too small and layout is compromised.
